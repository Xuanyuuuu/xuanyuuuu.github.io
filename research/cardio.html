        <p>To optimize dose selection during cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and reduce both procedural failures and radiation exposure, we collected a comprehensive dataset. This dataset includes body parameters, medical history, hereditary factors, and other relevant information. We used these data points to train a deep learning network to predict cardiac output, which in turn aids in selecting the optimal contrast dose for computed tomography angiography.</p>
