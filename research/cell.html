        <p>We extracted adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) from mice and embedded them in a hygrogel, which served as the structural meterial for cell printing. Using this hydrogel, we printed a cuboid in vitro and supplied it with nutrients and inducers to promote differentiation of the cells into hepatocytes. Additionally, we designed a biosensor specifically to detect hepatocytes within this 3D-printed construct, monitering the degree of the differentiation process. This work represents the first attempt at generating liver tissue from stem cells in a 3D vitro environment.</p>
