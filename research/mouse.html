        <h2>Devising a model to forecast the oscillation frequency within the olfactory bulbs of mice</h2>

        <p>This project served as foundational scientific training in data handling. The study aimed to integrate a range of behavioral indicators from rodents in a controlled experimental setting. Using various data analysis methods, we explored and evaluated the relationships among multiple parameters and their effects on olfactory bulb oscillation frequency. By thoroughly mapping these correlations, we improved the predictive accuracy of the GLM model.</p>
